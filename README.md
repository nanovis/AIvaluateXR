# **LoXR: Performance Evaluation of Locally Executing LLMs on XR Devices**  
![Teaser](images/LoXR.jpg)

## üèÜ **Acknowledgment**
LoXR is built upon **[`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)**.  [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) is an excellent C++ implementation for running LLMs efficiently on various hardware. 
We deployed **LLLMS** locally on **XR devices** by customizing the **[`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)** for four different XR devices. 

## üöÄ **Overview**  

**LoXR** is a framework for deploying and benchmarking **Large Language Models (LLMs) on XR devices**. It enables **on-device execution** of LLMs and provides tools for **performance analysis** across different XR platforms including:  

-  **Apple Vision Pro**  
-  **Magic Leap 2**  
- **Vivo X100 Pro**  
-  **Meta Quest 3**
